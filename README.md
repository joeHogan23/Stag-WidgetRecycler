# Stag-WidgetRecycler
A Widget Pooling System Editor and Game Module that recycles previously removed widgets. Unlike FWidgetPool, the Widget Recycler keeps widgets around until the next Garbage Collection, so it reallocates memory. Includes a GetOrCreateWidget K2Node for blueprint (works similarly to the default Create Widget)
